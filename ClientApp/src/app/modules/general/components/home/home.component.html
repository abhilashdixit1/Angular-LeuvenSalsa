    <h2>LeuvenSalsa! Latin Dance School</h2>
    <p>
      LeuvenSalsa! is a Leuven based Latin dance school started by Carl Hourcau
      in 2005.
    </p>
    <h3>We propose</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>dance classes in several styles</li>
      <li>parties</li>
      <li>the Leuven Salsa Festival (twice a year)</li>
      <li>the Salsa in Toscana holidays</li>
      <li>business events</li>
      <li>initiations and shows at private events</li>
      <li>private classes</li>
      <li>and other events in which fun and quality come together!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>
      LeuvenSalsa! proposes dance classes for salsa, tango, ladies' technique &
      styling, bachata, body movement and samba de gafieira. It is very
      important to us that all of our classes have these two characterics:
      'quality' and 'fun'! Our teachers propose classes with a clear structure
      and based on a global didactic plan. The LeuvenSalsa! teachers are
      caracterized by their didactic skills but also by their commitment and
      friendliness, creating a great dancing and learning environment. See the
      page for more details on our team. Our classes take place in different
      great locations in Leuven, all of which are well equiped dance halls.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning to dance</h3>
    <p>
      In order to learn how to dance you need to do more though than just to
      take classes. Practising is very important and that's why we organize free
      parties (every Monday and Wednesday in Caf√© Manger).
    </p>

    <h3>Challenging and variety</h3>

    <p>
      In order to make progress it is also nice to receive new input from other
      instructors. We will therefore very regularly invite guest instructors to
      come and challenge us all by showing other styles, other ways of teaching
      ... The Latin dance world is very varied and we're happy to show this
      variety for instance in the 'Leuven Salsa Festival' that we organize twice
      a year or in the 'Salsa in Toscana' stages that we propose in summer every
      year.
